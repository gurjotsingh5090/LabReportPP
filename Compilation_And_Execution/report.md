# Program Ex 01: Compilation And Execution

## Discussion
Compilation is the process the computer takes to convert a high-level programming language into a machine language that the computer can understand. 
The software which performs this conversion is called a compiler.
 
When our program has been converted to machine language, we need to execute it in order to see the output. 
Execution is the process by which a computer interprets the instructions of our program. 
For example, you have written a program to print your name. Then firstly, the compiler will convert your source code to machine code,
and after that your program will be executed i.e. the computer will perform the instructions of your program which say to print your name.

The main function is the starting point for our program execution and the execution ends at the end of main.
The main function controls execution by calling other functions in the program.

## Procedure

1. Enter into the public directory by giving command "cd public_html/".
2. Create a  new file by giving command "xmake create -l c Project-name ".
3. Edit the program.
4. Save the program by giving command "ctrl+s".
5. Exit the editor by giving command "ctrl+x".
6. Compile the program by giving command "xmake".
7. When the compiler says the above program is 100% OK then run the program by giving command "xmake run".

### Lessons Learned:

1. Learnt what is compilation and execution.
2. Learnt to use "cd" command.
3. Learnt to create new file using command "xmake create -l c Project-name".
4. Learnt to compile and run the program using commands "xmake" and "xmake run".
