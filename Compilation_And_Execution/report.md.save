# Program Ex 01: Compilation And Execution

## Discussion
Compilation is the process the computer takes to convert a high-level programming language into a machine language that the computer can understand.
The software which performs this conversion is called compiler.
   
When our program has been converted to machine language, we need to execute it in order to see the output. 
Execution is the process by which a computer interprets the  instructions of our program. For example, you have written a program to print your name. 
Then firstly, the compiler will convert your source code to machine code, and after that your program will be executed i.e. the computer will perform 
the instructions of your program which say to print your name.
The main function is the starting point for our program execution and the execution ends at the end of main.
 The main function controls execution by calling other functions in the program.
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    printf("hello world!\n");
    return 0;
}


## Procedure


### Lessons Learned:

1. What went well
1. What you would do differently next time
1. How the exercise might be revised to make it clearer/more satisfying
1. What the faculty members might have done differently to promote learning
